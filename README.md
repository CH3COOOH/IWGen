# IWGen Project
Generate a fucking simple image wall. From 2018.02.07.
Limited by my fucking poor knowledge of JS (as well as broken English, thus you may cannot understand what I am saying), every time that new images are added, you need to:
1. Run iwGen.py to build the file structure;
2. Make sure that there are not any characters that are not in English;
3. Make sure that the whole system run on a HTTP server (or some codes would not work).
4. 「なんだよこのゴミ」と思いつつ自分が何もできないという現実を受け止める。

I am looking forward to seeing that this script is edited to the style which makes me cannot believe that this script comes from me.

以上です。

[Update]  
2018.02.11 - Thumbnails are used thus the index would be loaded faster while you may need to install the damn PIL. (xx@xx: pip install pillow)  
2018.02.12 - Add preview mode. Considering of applying it to that hentai comic viewer.
